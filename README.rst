 A independent Fork of Django-FAQ from  Kevin Fricovsky
=======================================================

This is an independent fork of an old version of djang-faq by Kevin Fricovsky.
We've used a snapshot the django-faq since it was on bitbucket in a few of our
projects over the years. We were quite happy with this version but unfortunately
it recently started to get install problems with pip especially on python 2.7 on
OSX. Meanwhile
there was some development of the master branch on github and substantial
divergence of the forks but we preferred to use
our own version. 

Since it now appears that we have to maintain our fork we may take to
opportunity features like 
CBVs and support for bootstrap and foundation frameworks
